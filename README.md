# CSharp_NetCore

This repository contains my `C#` projects. Its main porpuse is to practice and strengthen my understanding on this sophisticated language.
As listed below:

### 02 - Basic calculator

This project is focused on try catch and error handling.
- Error inheritance.
- Custom Errors

### 03 - Delegates

Project based on the concept of `Delegates` in `C#`.

A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type.
When you instantiate a delegate, you can associate its instance with any method with a **compatible** signature and return type.
